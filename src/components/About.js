            I come from a farming background and managed to pursue my education despite financial challenges. After completing my 12th grade, I took the JEE exam and made it to college, but due to financial constraints, I joined a lower-tier college through the TFWS (Tuition Fee Waiver Scheme).

            Starting from my first year, I dived into coding and explored various programming languages and tools. My journey in college has been marked by hard work and dedication, and I’ve gained experience in web development, AI/ML, and problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, and more. I’ve also worked on several projects using Git, GitHub, and other development tools.

            My goal is to continue growing in technology, using my skills to make a difference and improve my community. My journey shows that with determination and hard work, it's possible to overcome obstacles and achieve success.
