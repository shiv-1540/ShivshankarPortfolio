          I come from a farming background and managed to pursue my education despite financial challenges. After completing my 12th grade, I took the JEE exam and made it to college, but due to financial constraints, I joined a lower-tier college through the TFWS (Tuition Fee Waiver Scheme).<br/><br/>

          Starting from my first year, I dived into coding and explored various programming languages and tools. My journey in college has been marked by hard work and dedication, and Iâ€™ve gained experience in web development ,AIML & Proble solving on different platforms, working on several projects using Git, GitHub, and other development tools.<br/><br/>

          My goal is to continue growing in technology, using my skills to make a difference and improve my community. My journey shows that with determination and hard work, it's possible to overcome obstacles and achieve success.
